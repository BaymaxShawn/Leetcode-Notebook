# ðŸ¥² 2492 - Minimum Score of a Path Between Two Cities

You are given a positive integer `n` representing `n` cities numbered from `1` to `n`. You are also given a **2D** array `roads` where `roads[i] = [ai, bi, distancei]` indicates that there is a **bidirectional** road between cities `ai` and `bi` with a distance equal to `distancei`. The cities graph is not necessarily connected.

The **score** of a path between two cities is defined as the **minimum** distance of a road in this path.

Return _the **minimum** possible score of a path between cities_ `1` _and_ `n`.

**Note**:

* A path is a sequence of roads between two cities.
* It is allowed for a path to contain the same road **multiple** times, and you can visit cities `1` and `n` multiple times along the path.
* The test cases are generated such that there is **at least** one path between `1` and `n`.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/12/graph11.png)

<pre><code><strong>Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,9],[2,3,6],[2,4,5],[1,4,7]]
</strong><strong>Output: 5
</strong><strong>Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 4. The score of this path is min(9,5) = 5.
</strong>It can be shown that no other path has less score.
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/10/12/graph22.png)

<pre><code><strong>Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,2],[1,3,4],[3,4,7]]
</strong><strong>Output: 2
</strong><strong>Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4. The score of this path is min(2,2,4,7) = 2.
</strong></code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 105`
* `1 <= roads.length <= 105`
* `roads[i].length == 3`
* `1 <= ai, bi <= n`
* `ai != bi`
* `1 <= distancei <= 104`
* There are no repeated edges.
* There is at least one path between `1` and `n`.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def minScore(self, n: int, roads: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        
        tem = defaultdict(list)
        for a,b,d in roads:
          tem[a].append((b,d))
          tem[b].append((a,d))

        def dfs(i):
          if i in visit:
            return
          visit.add(i)
          nonlocal res
          for m,n in tem[i]:
            res = min(res,n)
            dfs(m)

        res = inf
        visit = set()
        dfs(1)
        return res 

```
