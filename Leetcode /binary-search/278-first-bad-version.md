# ðŸ˜€ 278 - First Bad Version

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: n = 5, bad = 4
</strong><strong>Output: 4
</strong><strong>Explanation:
</strong>call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5)Â -> true
call isBadVersion(4)Â -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: n = 1, bad = 1
</strong><strong>Output: 1
</strong></code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= bad <= n <= 231 - 1`

## Solution

```python
# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# def isBadVersion(version: int) -> bool:

class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:

        l , r = 0,n

        while l < r :
            mid = (l+r)//2
            if isBadVersion(mid) is True:
                r = mid
            else:
                l = mid +1
        
        return l 

```
